## What’s Inside  
This isn't a traditional portfolio. We built a full desktop experience in the browser, where each app is a window into who we are.  
Click on icons, open apps, drag things around, and explore our work — just like you would on a real Windows PC.

Apps like:  
- **Visual Studio Code** – where you’ll find our developer side  
- **Notepad** – a place for simple, direct writing  
- **Internet Explorer** – for external links  
- **MS Paint**, **CMD**, **Adobe Acrobat**, **Outlook**, and more – each one with a story or a section  
- **Microsoft Teams** – where we reflect on working together as a team  

It even comes with a working Start Menu, Taskbar, draggable windows, real-time clock, and a few easter eggs if you know where to look.
